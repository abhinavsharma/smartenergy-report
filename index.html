						<h1>About the Project</h1>
  					</div>
  					<p>The Smart Energy Visualization project is a collaborative project between Bosch Research and the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Human-Computer Interaction department. Through our research, we will discover what information is most relevant to users&#146; energy consumption. From there, we will seek to create an actionable interface that increases energy awareness for users and builds our skill sets in user research, data visualization, and overall interface usability. We will determine a target population of interest and create an information display meant to influence the users&#146; behavior related to energy conservation.
  					<br /><br />
            The goal of the project is to make use of Bosch&#146;s non-intrusive load monitoring sensors to provide bill-payers with actionable information on their energy usage. Our preliminary audience included home owners, landlords and facility managers; this audience has been narrowed based on the results of our user-research. Through our research, we gathered information to evaluate the incentives users desire through interviews and discovered what information is most actionable, leading to a refined specificity of the information they require.</p>

						<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
  					</div>
  					<p>
  					  Through our user research process documented below, we narrowed the scope of the project
  					  to home owners. Furthermore, specific to home owners, we listed some design goals:
  					  
  					  <ul>
  					    
  					    <li>Disaggregated information has been proven to be effective in helping
  					      save energy (from literature review)</li>
  					    
  					    <li>Goal setting helps with curtailing energy usage if the goals are specific.</li>
  					    
  					    <li>There is a very wide range of how much home owners care about energy use.
  					    </li>
  					      
  					    <li>Home owners do not consider their electric bills to be private or sensitive 
  					        information
    					  </li>
    					  
    					  <li>Users would like to be made aware of anomalies in their energy usage.</li>

						<h1>Platforms</h1>
  					</div>
  					  <p>In the early part of the design process, we considered different interfaces
  					    for the system to potentially use. These were:
  					    
  					    <ul>
  					      <li><b>Mobile:</b> The major advantage of using a mobile interface is that
  					        its easy for the user to access from wherever they are. The major disadvantage
  					        is that the screen is small and thus may be inconvenient for complex
  					        visualizations. Through iteration, we realized that people want simple
  					        visualizations and thus eliminated the need for a very large screen. We thus
  					        chose mobile for our final implementation.</li>
  					      
  					      <li><b>Web:</b> A web based display is good because it is accessible from a 
  					        large number of devices but is still large enough to accommodate complex
  					        visualizations and graphs. However, it is not as accessible as mobile.</li>
  					      
  					      <li><b>Wall Mounted:</b> The main advantage to a wall-mounted display is that
  					        it is dedicated to the device and does not have the overhead of requiring
  					        a computer/phone to operate. However, it does not have the mobility of a phone
  					        and adds overhead cost.</li>
  					    </ul></p>
  					    
  					    <p>We storyboarded and sketched frames for each use case to help us with walking 
  					      through potential use cases with users while speed-dating the concepts</p>

						<h1>Personas</h1>
  					</div>
  					  <p>In order to accommodate the needs of our different user groups, we generated 
  					    three very different personas. As we worked through concepts, we related concepts
  					    to the mindset of each of these personas to see if our solution would be consistent
  					    with the needs of each kind of user.</p>

						<h1>Design Implications from Research</h1>
  					</div>
  					<h2>Ambient Information</h2>
  					<p>We learnt from research that users do not want to constantly keep checking on
  					  their energy usage. Instead, they would prefer being notified of any anomalies
  					  or significant changes in their usage behavior.</p>
  					  
  					<p>We have made this a core feature of our application by making the home page
  					  have a notification system that adapts over time to the user's needs.</p>
  					  
  					<ul class="thumbnails">  
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/notif1.png" >
                <div class="caption">Actions Inbox on home page</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/notif2.png" >
                <div class="caption">Suggested actions</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/notif3.png" >
                <div class="caption">Previously taken actions.</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/notif4.png" >
                <div class="caption">Previously taken actions.</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            </ul>
  					  
  					
  					<h2>Diverse User Needs</h2>
  					  <p>We discovered through our user research that even within home owners
  					    the information requirement of the audience was greatly varied. The 
  					    one common need was to be told of anomalies through a messaging system.</p>
  					  
  					  <p>Thus, we designed the home page to be flexible and work with interchageble
  					    widgets that the user can enable and disable to get the information most
  					    relevant to them on their home page.</p>
  					
  					<ul class="thumbnails">  
            
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/widget1.png" >
                <div class="caption">Energy Budget Widget.</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" target="_blank" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/widget2.png" >
                <div class="caption">Live Usage Widget.</div>
              </a>
            </li>
            </ul>
  					
  					<h2>Willingness to Share</h2>
  					  <p>We discovered that people do not consider their energy usage information to
  					    be private or sensitive and are thus willing to share it with others. To 
  					    leverage this, we designed methods to help people compare their usage
  					    information with friends as well as a reference point for other similar 
  					    households.</p>
  					
  					<ul class="thumbnails">  
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/peer1.png" >
                <div class="caption">Choose friends to compare to</div>
                </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/peer2.png" >
                <div class="caption">Comparison to friend and an intelligently determined average</div>
                </a>
            </li>
            </ul>
  					
  					<h2>Effectively Using Disaggregated Information</h2>
  					  <p>Our literature review proved that disaggregated information was effective
  					    in lowering energy use but did not mention exactly how it was used. We visualized
  					    disaggregated information in multiple ways including the ability to see usage
  					    information by device.</p>
  					
  					<ul class="thumbnails">  
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/appl1.png" >
                <div class="caption">Appliance list sorted by usage</div>
                </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
              <a href="#" class="thumbnail">
                <img src="img/appl2.png" >
                <div class="caption">Time series for each appliance</div>
                </a>
            </li>
            </ul>
  					  
  					  <p>Also, we allow users to compare energy usage between their devices using a treemap, 
  					    which we chose over a pie chart because it scales better to more devices.</p>
  					
  					<ul class="thumbnails">

						<h1>Future Work</h1>
  					</div>
  					<p>We tried incorporating most ideas possible into our design. However, since we were
  					  constantly iterating until the end, there are some design ideas as well as important
  					  points that we would like to point out as important when designing such a system in the
  					   future</p>
  					
  					<ul>
  					  <li><b>Web Version:</b> We initially prototyped a web version of the product that we 
  					    then abandoned due to time constraints. However, we originally imagined this as a
  					    combination of a web and mobile interface. The larger screen is better suited to 
  					    detailed analysis of the data and higher fidelity visualizations. 
  					  </li>
  					  
  					  <li><b>Other Audiences:</b> A large part of our initial research was focused on 
  					    determining use cases for this system for lanlords and facility managers. We ultimately
  					    chose to design for home owners because of ease of access and their control over the
  					    household, however we found strong demand for the system within small business owners and
  					    landlords. These audiences should by no means be considered a bad fit for the system.
  					  </li>
              
              <li><b>Notifications and Feedback:</b> The notification system was designed to allow for
  					    user feedback. It is critical that the system learns from feedback and adjusts to showing
  					    or hiding similar information in the future depending on the user's choices. The 
  					    notification system itself would require significantly more behavioral study to determine
  					    effective techniques for changing user behavior over time. Our intention with the
  					    notification system was to put in place a framework for communicating directly about
  					    issues with the user. However, the content for this system is in itself a very challenging
  					    problem.
  					  </li>
  					  
  					  <li><b>Extending Widgets:</b> The development of home page widgets as a flexible 
  					    interchangeble set of visualizations was a fairly late decision in the design
  					    process. Since the intent of widgets is to allow the user to have the information
  					    most useful to them on the home page, widgets could be extended with more visualizations 
  					    as well as the ability to put up graphs for certain devices or any other page in the
  					    website as a widget.
  					  </li>
  					  
  					</ul>
